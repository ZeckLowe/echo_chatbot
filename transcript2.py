sample_transcript2 = """[00:00:00] John: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's kickoff meeting for our new \
    software development project. We'll be discussing the project scope, timelines, and
    responsibilities. Let's get started with a quick round of introductions. I'll go first. I'm John, the \
    project manager. I'll be overseeing the project and ensuring we stay on track. Alice, would you \
    like to go next?
    [00:00:20]
    Alice: Sure, thanks John. Hi, everyone. I'm Alice, the lead developer. I'll be responsible for the
    overall architecture and development of the software. Looking forward to working with all of you.
    [00:00:35]
    Bob: Hi, I'm Bob, the UI/UX designer. I'll be handling the design aspects of the software, making
    sure it's user-friendly and visually appealing.
    [00:00:45]
    Sara: Hello, I'm Sara, the QA analyst. I'll be testing the software to ensure it meets our quality
    standards and is free of bugs.
    [00:00:55]
    John: Great, thank you. Now that we've introduced ourselves, let's dive into the project scope.
    Our goal is to develop a new customer management system for our client. The system should
    allow users to manage customer data, track interactions, and generate reports. Alice, can you
    give us an overview of the technical requirements?
    [00:01:20]
    Alice: Sure, John. The system will be built using a microservices architecture. We'll be using
    Java for the backend services and React for the frontend. The database will be PostgreSQL.
    We also need to ensure that the system is scalable and secure, as it will handle sensitive
    customer information.
    [00:01:45]
    Bob: For the design, we'll focus on creating an intuitive user interface. I'll be working closely with
    Alice to ensure that the design is feasible from a development perspective. I'll also be
    conducting user research to understand the needs of our end-users better.
    [00:02:05]
    Sara: From a QA perspective, I'll be developing a comprehensive testing plan. This will include
    unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. We'll also set up automated testing
    to streamline the process.
    [00:02:20]
    John: Excellent. Now, let's talk about the project timeline. We have a six-month timeframe to
    complete this project. Here's a high-level breakdown of the phases:
    Planning and Design: 1 month
    Development: 3 months
    Testing: 1 month
    Deployment and Review: 1 month
    We'll have bi-weekly check-ins to monitor progress and address any issues. Any questions or
    concerns about the timeline?
    [00:02:50]
    Alice: That timeline looks reasonable to me. We just need to make sure we stick to the schedule
    and avoid scope creep.
    [00:03:00]
    Bob: Agreed. As long as we have clear communication and everyone stays on top of their tasks,
    we should be able to meet the deadlines.
    [00:03:10]
    Sara: I'll make sure to start testing as soon as we have the first build ready. This way, we can
    catch any issues early and avoid delays.
    [00:03:20]
    John: Sounds good. Before we wrap up, let's quickly go over the responsibilities. Alice lead the
    development team, ensure code quality and performance. Bob design the UI/UX, conduct user
    research, collaborate with developers. Sara develop and execute the testing plan, ensure
    software quality. John oversee the project, coordinate between teams, ensure timely delivery.
    If there are no further questions, we'll conclude the meeting. Thank you all for your time and let's
    make this project a success.
    [00:03:50]
    All: Thank you, John.
